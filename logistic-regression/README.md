### Logistic regression 

- data cleansing, feature engineer 
    - analyze data 
- binary classification with logistic regression 
- model evaluation 
- feature important 
- predictor coefficients 

- predict binary outcome -> logistic regression 
- scikit-learn 

- create target for the model 



- design matrix for predictor vars 
    - size of opening gap
    - month
    - day of IPO
    - offering price 
    - lead manager 
    - number of managers 
    - star rating 

- dummy coding 



- examine model performance
    - small losses 
    - 
- generate importance of a feature from model 
    - posibility of positive outcome 
    - size of coefficient 
    - generate importance of feature from the model 

- random forest classifier method
