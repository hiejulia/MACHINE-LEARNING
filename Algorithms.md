# Problem set & some possible solution 
## Anomaly detection 
- Simple time series model AR or ARMA 
    - predict graph next hour -> error is too big -> anomaly 
    - estimate model : variance of error 
        - distribution assumption, normal -> set threshold based on probability
- Time series: LSTM 
- Isolation Forest, 1 class SVM 
- AE Neural Net
- Supervised 
- How to deal with seasonal freq
    - Seasonal trend decomposition using loess 
    - Non linear regression to establish threshold around that mid point, based on relationship between the variance and the level 

- Other statistical method 
    - change point detection (mean, variance)
        - maximum likelihood estimation 
    - Statistical Process Control
